This is a Chat Web Application created using Langchain, OpenAI and Streamlit. Just clone and run the following command in the terminal

```
streamlit run chat.py
```

You can change the behavior of the chat agent by editing the 'systemplate' variable in the chat.py file. Currently, the chat agent is prompted to not encourage violence and show empathy to the users who chat. This is a kind of personal chat buddy. Don't forget to use your own OpenAI API Key in the .env file.
